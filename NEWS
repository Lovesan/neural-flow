v0.3.1
    * Several minor optimizations

v0.3.0
    * Neurons' dependents are now stored in a Red-Black tree in the form of
        weak pointers
    * Neurons are now able to muffle their signals, i.e. now they can
        stop the propagation of the flow on their dependents.
        Have a look at 'muffled-example' function in examples/neurons.lisp
    * All instances of dataflow-class metaclass and its descendants now
        have dataflow-object class as default superclass

v0.2.0
    * Completely redesigned dataflow model. Dependencies are now calculated
        dynamically(no more add-connection and so on), much like in `cells'
    * Have a look at `examples'

v0.1.1
    * Renamed neuron-dendrites to neuron-receivers

v0.1.0
    * Initial release.
